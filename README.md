# form-validator
JavaScript form validator

Using JavaScript, this validator performs some basic form validation

* Checking for content in each field
* Making sure email is in valid format
* Making sure user name and password are of sufficient lengths
* Confirming both password entries are the same

For valid fields, the infput field gets a green border, for invalid fields, the field gets a red border and a message below indicating what needs to be fixed.
